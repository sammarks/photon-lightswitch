# Photon Lightswitch

This is a simple API that uses my current location to determine whether or not
a lightswitch should be turned on or off.

I offload the logic to this API to keep the script running on the photon as simple
as possible.

## Ideas

Possible ideas I have for expansion:

- Check cloud conditions in the area (turn the lights on when it's cloudy or
	stormy).
